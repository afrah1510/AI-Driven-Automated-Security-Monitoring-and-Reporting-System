# 🔐 AI-Driven Automated Security Monitoring and Reporting System

## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on building and testing **deep learning models** for an AI-based security monitoring system.
At the current stage, the work includes **training and running models** related to vehicle detection, license plate detection, and incident classification.

The project is a foundation for an automated surveillance system that can later be extended to real-time monitoring and reporting.

## 🎯 Current Work Done

The following components have been implemented and tested:

* Vehicle detection using YOLO models
* License plate detection using YOLO models
* Cropping of license plate regions from detected vehicles
* Incident classification using CNN and MobileNetV2 models
* Model training and evaluation using image datasets

⚠️ **Note:**
End-to-end automation, real-time video processing, dashboards, and alert systems are **not implemented yet**.
